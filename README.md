# HighLowVoice-iOS-Swift
iOS App programmed in Swift that records the voice conversation of two people and changes the pitch to high or low

## Learning Goals
* Learn Swift 5, Apple's Programming language, as well as XCode, the Integrated Development Environment used to create native Apple applications for iOS devices.

* Utilize Storyboards to design an interface, and use AutoLayout, UIButtons, and UILabels to create an interface.

* Make a ViewController to react to touch events and change the views according to a user's input.

* Implement AVAudioRecorder, Delegation, and Programmatic Segues in order to set up Audio Recording on an iOS application.

* Setup audio playback with rate, pitch, echo, and reverb. Learn about UIStackViews and class extensions.

* Complete an entire iOS application from start to finish using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) Software Architecture, which allows for separation of concerns and division of responsibilities on a project.
